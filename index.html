    <h1>Structure of URL</h1>
    <p>
        A URL, or Uniform Resource Locator, is structured to provide a clear address for a resource on the internet.
        Here are the main components of a URL:
    </p>
    <h3>Protocol:</h3>
    <p>This is the first part of a URL, indicating the method for fetching the resource, such as HTTP, HTTPS, or FTP.
        HTTPS is the secure version of HTTP, encrypting data for secure transmission.</p>
    <h3>Subdomain:</h3>
    <p>This is an optional part that appears before the domain name and is used to organize different sections of a
        website. For example, “blog” in “blog.example.com” indicates a blog section.</p>
    <h3>Domain Name:</h3>
    <p>This is the main name of the website, such as “example” in “example.com”. It must be unique and determines the
        address of the website.</p>
    <h3>Top-Level Domain (TLD):</h3>
    <p>This specifies the type of entity the organization registers as on the internet, such as “.com” for commercial
        sites, “.org” for organizations, or “.edu” for educational institutions.</p>
    <h3>Port:</h3>
    <p>This is a number used to specify a connection endpoint, directing data to a specific service. For example, HTTP
        uses port 80, and HTTPS uses port 443.</p>
    <h3>Path:</h3>
    <p>This specifies the location of the file or resource on the server. It can be structured like a directory path,
        but it often abstractly represents the navigational structure of the website.</p>
    <h3>Query Parameters:</h3>
    <p>These are optional and appear after a question mark (?). They provide extra information to the server, such as
        search terms or page numbers.</p>
    <h3>Fragment:</h3>
    <p>This is also optional and appears after a hash (#). It instructs the browser to scroll to a specific part of the
        webpage upon loading.</p>

    <h1>Agile Methodology</h1>
    <p>An agile methodology is an iterative approach to software development. Each iteration of agile methodology takes
        a short time interval of 1 to 4 weeks. The agile development process is aligned to deliver the changing business
        requirement. It distributes the software with faster and fewer changes.

        The single-phase software development takes 6 to 18 months. In single-phase development, all the requirement
        gathering and risks management factors are predicted initially.

        The agile software development process frequently takes the feedback of workable product. The workable product
        is delivered within 1 to 4 weeks of iteration.</p>

    <h1>waterfall Methodology</h1>
    <p>The waterfall methodology is a sequential project management approach used in software development and other
        industries. It consists of distinct phases that must be completed in a specific order before moving on to the
        next phase. These phases typically include requirements gathering, design, implementation, testing, and
        deployment. The waterfall model is characterized by its linear and structured process, which relies on careful
        planning and detailed documentation upfront. While it offers clear planning and control, it may not be suitable
        for projects with changing requirements.</p>

    <h1>Devops</h1>
    <p>DevOps combines development (Dev) and operations (Ops) to increase the efficiency, speed, and security of
        software development and delivery compared to traditional processes. A more nimble software development
        lifecycle results in a competitive advantage for businesses and their customers. DevOps can be best explained as
        people working together to conceive, build and deliver secure software at top speed. DevOps practices enable
        software development (dev) and operations (ops) teams to accelerate delivery through automation, collaboration,
        fast feedback, and iterative improvement. Stemming from an Agile approach to software development, a DevOps
        process expands on the cross-functional approach of building and shipping applications in a faster and more
        iterative manner.

        In adopting a DevOps development process, you are making a decision to improve the flow and value delivery of
        your application by encouraging a more collaborative environment at all stages of the development cycle.DevOps
        represents a change in mindset for IT culture. In building on top of Agile, lean practices, and systems theory,
        DevOps focuses on incremental development and rapid delivery of software. Success relies on the ability to
        create a culture of accountability, improved collaboration, empathy, and joint responsibility for business
        outcomes.</p>

    <h1>SDLC</h1>
    <p>The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a structured process used to design, develop, test, and maintain
        software applications. It aims to deliver high-quality, cost-effective, and secure software that meets customer
        expectations. The SDLC typically includes several phases:</p>
    <h3>Requirements Gathering and Analysis:</h3>
    <p>This phase involves collecting and analyzing user requirements to define the scope of the project.</p>
    <h3>Design:</h3>
    <p>The software architecture, data structures, and interfaces are designed based on the requirements.</p>
    <h3>Implementation or Coding:</h3>
    <p>Developers write the code according to the design specifications.</p>
    <h3>Testing:</h3>
    <p>The software is tested to ensure it meets the requirements and functions correctly.</p>
    <h3>Deployment:</h3>
    <p>The software is released to the production environment and made available to end-users.</p>
    <h3>Maintenance:</h3>
    <p>This phase includes ongoing support, bug fixes, and updates to the software.</p>
